      <h3>IF IT'S MEANT TO BE</h3>
      <p>
        That I should've bought you flowers<br>
        And held your hand<br>
        Should've gave you all my hours<br>
        When I had the chance<br>
        Take you to every party<br>
       'Cause all you wanted to do was dance<br>
        Now my baby's dancing<br>
        But she's dancing with another man<br>
        My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways<br>
        Caused a good strong woman like you<br>
        To walk out my life<br>
        Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made<br>
        And it haunts me every time I close my eyes<br>
        It all just sounds like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
        Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize<br>

      <h3>NO LOVE ALLOWED</h3>
      <p>
        9-1-1, it's a critical emergency, yeah<br>
        Better run run run<br>
        Come and charge him with the 1-4-3, yeah<br>
        Told me this world was mine<br>
        Such a beautiful lie<br>
        Now he's done done done and his love is no more for me, eh<br>
        Hand in the air as he wave me goodbye<br>
        He said he care but no tears in his eyes<br>
        And ask me if I'm alright<br>
        Nigga, is you blind<br>
        Like a bullet your love hit me to the core<br>
        I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor<br>
        And it's so foolish of you keep me wanting more<br>
        I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us<br>
        I call it murder, no love allowed<br>
      </p>

      <h3>WHEN I'M IN YOUR ARMS</h3>
      <p>
        Old wounds<br>
        Old fights<br>
        Another day<br>
        Goes by<br>
        I'm not playing by the rules<br>
        They can't take me for no fool<br>
        Are you gonna ride with me? Hold me down, will you listen<br>
        Never lie to me?<br>
        This is all the sign I need<br>
        So tell me<br>
        Will you keep me safe when<br>
        I'm in your arms?<br>
        I'm in your arms<br>
        Control me<br>
       'Cause it feels so good<br>
        When I'm in your arms<br>
        I don't want you going nowhere<br>
       'Cause on the corners of your mind<br>
        Helps my body to unwind<br>
        Don't waste time<br>
