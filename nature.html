      <h3>I WANDERED LONELY AS A COULD</h3>
      <p>
        I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
        That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br>
        When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
        A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
        Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
        Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br>

        Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
        And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
        They stretched in never-ending line<br>
        Along the margin of a bay:<br>
        Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
        Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br>

        The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
        Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
        A poet could not but be gay,<br>
        In such a jocund company:<br>
        I gazedâ€”and gazedâ€”but little thought<br>
        What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>

        For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
        In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
        They flash upon that inward eye<br>
        Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
        And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
        And dances with the daffodils.<br>
